# Lando setup for Graham

Here are some commands you may need to get going with this:

 - `lando start`: This fires up the server and at the end, gives you a URL for your webroot.
 - `lando mysql lamp`: This drops you into a MySQL command prompt in the `lamp` database.
 - `lando ssh`: This drops you into a command shell, logged in as `www-data`
 - `lando ssh -u root`: This drops you into a command shell, logged in as `root`, so you can install packages.
